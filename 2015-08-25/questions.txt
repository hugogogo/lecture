## How many are you?

In the first lecture, we ran a parallel protocol for counting attendance:

 - Rightmost person per row counts all in row
 - When done counting, raises hand
 - State number in row when called on

after which the instructor gets to gather and sum the row counts.

In practice, this took X time.  This includes

A: Ideally assume there are N rows, each row has M students. Then
Total student number = M * N. Each student takes t_i time to count. 
Time to gather one row is t_g. Time to do one addition and assignment
is t_a.

Then
 - Time to start the process = t_s
 - Time to compute row counts = t_i * M
 - Time for the instructor to gather counts = t_g * N
 - Time for instructor to do the arithmetic = t_a * N

Consider the following questions:

1. What is a simple model that would predict this time?
A: t_1 = t_s + t_i * M + t_g * N + t_a * N

2. What about a simple model to predict time for one person to count?
A: Then
the total time for one person would be 
   t_2 = t_i * M * N

3. How big should the class be before the parallel method takes less time?
A: Asking t_1 <= t_2 is equivalent to 
   t_s + t_i * M + t_g * N + t_a * N <= t_i * M * N
